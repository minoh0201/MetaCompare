# MetaCompare

MetaCompare is a computational pipeline for prioritizing resistome risk by estimating the potential for ARGs to be disseminated into human pathogens from a given environmental sample based on metagenomic sequencing data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine or server.

### System Requirements (*tested on linux Ubuntu 14.04*)

* git installed
* Python3 with `pandas` and `biopython` package installed
  * `pip install pandas`
  * `pip install biopython`
* Blast 2.2.8 or higher version installed

### Installing

**Step 1:** Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned `MetaCompare` directory to be made.
**Step 2:** Clone the repository using git command
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/minoh0201/MetaCompare
```

**Step 3:** Make directory `BlastDB` under `MetaCompare` directory and change the woring directory to it.

```
~$ cd MetaCompare
~/MetaCompare$ mkdir BlastDB
~/MetaCompare$ cd BlastDB
~/MetaCompare/BlastDB$
```

**Step 4:** Download the compressed Blast Database file from the web server (25 GB) and uncompress it.

```
~/MetaCompare/BlastDB$ wget http://bench.cs.vt.edu/ftp/data/metacomp/BlastDB.tar.gz
~/MetaCompare/BlastDB$ tar -zxvf BlastDB.tar.gz
```
*Note:* In case url does not work, alternative url to download BlastDB: `https://zenodo.org/records/10471551`

*Note2:* If you are encountering `ERROR: cannot verify bench.cs.vt.edu's certificate`, execute wget command with `--no-check-certificate` option (`wget http://bench.cs.vt.edu/ftp/data/metacomp/BlastDB.tar.gz --no-check-certificate`).

**Step 5:** Get back to working directory `MetaCompare` and run `metacmp.py`

```
~/MetaCompare/BlastDB$ cd ..
~/MetaCompare$ ./metacmp.py
```

## Running MetaCompare

### Preparing input files

MetaCompare requires two FASTA files as inputs, one for the assembled contigs generated by IDBA-UD and the other for predicted gene list derived from the assembled contigs using prodigal. 

#### Option 1 (*recommanded*)

If you have raw reads you can submit them to MetaStorm (http://bench.cs.vt.edu/MetaStorm/) and run assembly pipeline to get assembled contigs and predicted gene list. MetaStorm's assembly pipeline uses trimmomatic for quality control of raw reads, IDBA-UD for assembly, and prodigal for gene prediction.

The input files we need can be downloaded from MetaStorm by clicking `Scaffolds` button (for assembled contigs) and `Genes` button (for predicted genes) in the assembled sample page.

#### Option 2

You can directly install and run trimmomatic (https://github.com/timflutre/trimmomatic), IDBA-UD (https://github.com/loneknightpy/idba) and prodigal (https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) to process your raw reads in order to get the inputs.

### Running

Suppose you have the assembled contigs file, `S1.fa`, and predicted gene list `S1_genes.fa` (*These files are already in your working directory*).

The following command runs MetaCompare with 128 threads.

```
~$ ./metacmp.py -c S1.fa -g S1_genes.fa -t 128
```
The output should be look like as follows:
```
Running blastn on ACLAME
Running blastx on CARD
Running blastn on PATRIC
Reading files...
Computing resistome risk score..
Resistome risk score: 38.64014990951873
```

You can see detailed description for command line options by using `-h` option.
```
~$ ./metacmp.py -h
```
